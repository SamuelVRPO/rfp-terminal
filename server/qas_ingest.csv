"How do you decide to buy or sell a security?", "To include a security in a portfolio, it must contribute value relative to its level of risk and be consistent with the portfolio’s objectives and guidelines. Our decision-making process has three steps: security identification, analysis, and risk assessment. Each analyst/manager rates securities in his industry according to creditworthiness and value.", Core Plus, Pension, US, "decision,buy,sell,value"
"How do you decide to buy or sell a security?", "Securities are then placed on a grid that allows them to assess the securities across industries, sectors and countries. On a weekly basis, every security is re-evaluated, and every security must fight for its position in the portfolio", Core Plus, Pension, US, "asses,buy,sell,grid"
"How do you decide to buy or sell a security?", "Our internal security rating discipline helps us categorize our credits by creditworthiness and value which helps us compare investments across sectors, industries and countries. As part of this discipline, we categorize each security either investment grade or high yield according to its volatility and price. For example, we may categorize an investment grade security as “High Yield” based on price and volatility. We believe our analysts/managers’ ability to understand and access opportunities across the rating spectrum, industries, and countries give us an advantage over other managers.", Core Plus, Pension, US, "improvement,change,evolution"
"How do you decide to buy or sell a security?", "Every new investment is brought to the team (consisting at all times of at least one other manager, generally the Chief Investment Officer) for consideration.

Under no circumstance can an analyst/manager add an investment without the agreement of at least one other analyst/manager.", Core Plus, Pension, US, "decision,buy,sell,agreement,authorization"
"How do you decide to buy or sell a security?", "Our objective is to purchase and hold securities of improving creditworthiness and attractive relative value, and to sell those of deteriorating creditworthiness and poor relative value. A security becomes a sell candidate if it no longer provides an appropriate return for the credit risk or we identify a replacement security that provides a better return/risk profile. We have a 10% rule that requires us to immediately review a credit if the price of the security rises or falls by 10% or more. No analyst/manager can make a buy/sell decision on their own, they must consult with at least one other member of the team. If there is disagreement, ultimate decision-making authority rests with the Chief Investment Officer",Core Plus, Pension, US, "decision,authority,buy,sell,disagreement"

"Specify the portfolio guidelines, such as the maximum issuer, issue, sector, currency, duration, etc. weights. Describe any quantitative techniques or optimization tools used to construct portfolios.", "A key philosophical and process related principle is “do not take unintended risks.” This policy, in effect, places limits on exposures that by their size or composition add risks we do not want to take. As an example, if companies in an industry become attractive on a risk/return basis, we may want to purchase some of their bonds, but not in aggregate amounts that make the portfolio overly sensitive to the industry.", Core Plus, Pension, US, "guidelines,strategy,portfolio management"

"Please describe the portfolio manager’s ability to invest in any out-of-benchmark securities", "GIA’s investment team has invested in out-of-benchmark securities since the inception of the firm.

"Please describe how your firm measures portfolio risk. How is it monitored and controlled? State whether it is on an absolute or relative basis.", "Our risk control focuses on the credit dimension in the portfolio seeking to measure what value we are getting relative to the risk. This analysis covers ratings migration, default risk, and call option risk. Interest rate and yield curve risks are neutralized and sector exposures result from the value in the credit sectors. Other risks, like liquidity and event risk are managed by ensuring the portfolio is properly compensated for assuming those risks.", Core Plus, Pension, US, "risk,portfolio management"
"Please describe how your firm measures portfolio risk. How is it monitored and controlled? State whether it is on an absolute or relative basis.", "Our portfolio exposures such as duration, credit quality, and credit ratings. are monitored daily through our proprietary Fixed Income Portfolio System (FIPS), and Bloomberg. Within FIPS, we have a framework to analyze portfolios by sectors, industries, and countries. FIPS draws portfolio analytics from Bloomberg. Aggregated market factor risks are easily viewed daily and shown relative to the client’s benchmark. Exposure to these aggregated factors relative to the benchmark is always considered in context of current tactical strategy and client risk tolerance.", Core Plus, Pension, US, "risk,portfolio management"
"Please describe how your firm measures portfolio risk. How is it monitored and controlled?

"Please describe how your firm measures portfolio risk. How is it monitored and controlled? State whether it is on an absolute or relative basis.", "In respect to individual or specific risk, drill down capability allows the portfolio managers and the CIO to quickly review the fundamentals or the market behavior (technicals) of a specific security. The system then allows for the translation of a specific risk to total portfolio impact. We have a scenario analysis model that enables us to test each portfolio against changes in spreads, interest rates and yield curve. The whole system is interactive and exists on each analyst/manager’s desktop allowing easy exploration of any risk exposure question.", Core Plus, Pension, US, "risk,portfolio management"

"How does your firm currently measure/track risk for this product (e.g., standard deviation, duration times spread, contribution to duration, other?)", "We seek a balance between minimizing risk, measured by standard deviation, and maximizing total return. We think of performance metrics in a broad asset allocation context. In fixed income, high yield and many emerging markets securities at times display higher correlation with equities than high quality bonds. This characteristic adds diversification and yield to Core fixed income portfolios, and sometimes contributes additional volatility. Over time, we believe the return contribution exceeds the risk contribution making the combination valuable to investors", Core Plus, Pension, US, "risk,portfolio management"
"How does your firm currently measure/track risk for this product (e.g., standard deviation, duration times spread, contribution to duration, other?)", "We consider yield curve, duration, and top-down sector allocation to involve macro-related risks, which are hard to get consistently right and for which we believe the risk/benefit relationship is unfavorable to clients. Therefore, we manage portfolios largely duration neutral within +/- 0.5 year to the benchmark.", Core Plus, Pension, US, "risk,portfolio management"
"How does your firm currently measure/track risk for this product (e.g., standard deviation, duration times spread, contribution to duration, other?)", "Credit quality, country allocation and industry and sector exposure result from our bottom-up portfolio construction. Portfolio exposures such as duration, credit quality, credit ratings, etc. are monitored daily relative to the benchmark.", Core Plus, Pension, US, "risk,portfolio management"
"Do you stress test your portfolios? If so, how do you stress test your portfolios?", "Our proprietary Fixed Income Portfolio System (FIPS) allows us to measure the impact on each portfolio given changes in interest rates, yield curve, ratings, and sectors. Stress tests are conducted by assuming sizable changes to some or all of the variables affecting the portfolio. During an event such as March 2020, poor liquidity was reflected in higher spreads, wider bid-offer quotes, reduced liquidity, and significant volatility. Since it is difficult to precisely measure liquidity constraints on every security, we stress the portfolios by sector and ratings with the smaller, lower quality sectors penalized more harshly.", Core Plus, Pension, US, "risk,portfolio management,stress"
"Describe under what market conditions you expect your product to do well and to do poorly. Describe what, if any, exposure you have to momentum", "Our bottom-up, credit driven, relative value process tends to outperform during periods when credit risk/reward analysis is at a premium. This tends to occur during periods of economic growth, recovery, and stability. Since our investment process looks for value globally across the credit spectrum (AAA – CCC) and across sectors (investment grade, high yield and emerging markets), we adjust the securities in our portfolios as value and market conditions change.", Core Plus, Pension, US, "portfolio management,performance"
"Describe under what market conditions you expect your product to do well and to do poorly.
